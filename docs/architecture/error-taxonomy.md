# Error Taxonomy & HTTP Status

> **Status:** Landed 2026-06-19. Owner: CTO. Source task: [Task 246 — Error taxonomy: business-rule rejections must return 4xx](../planning/tasks/246-error-taxonomy-business-rule-4xx.md).

This is the **single source of truth** for how the backend classifies errors and what HTTP status the caller should see. The rule is short and absolute:

> **Every business-rule rejection returns a structured 4xx with a meaningful domain `code` and a Law 5 `guard`. Genuine infrastructure failures (DB, network, transaction conflict) return 5xx. Nothing in between.**

If you are adding a use case that can refuse a request, read this before picking an error class. If you are debugging "the API said 500 / INFRA_999 / critical but the request looked legit," read §4 (the taxonomy) and §5 (the rule).

## 1. The five error classes

| Class | HTTP | When to use | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PostingError` (and subclasses `SalesRuleError`, `VoucherRuleError`, `PurchaseRuleError`, `PeriodLockedError`, `PersonaNotAllowedError`) | **400** | Business-rule rejection. Lifecycle guards, settlement rules, accounting policies, persona governance, period lock. | `backend/src/domain/{shared,sales,accounting,purchases}/errors/` |
| `CreditLimitExceededError` | **422** | Sales credit-limit guard refused the operation (it carries rich numbers; the handler renders them in the body). | `backend/src/domain/sales/errors/CreditLimitExceededError.ts` |
| `AppError` (with `severity` = `INFO`/`WARNING`/`ERROR`) | **200 / 400** | Validation, provider errors with their own status mapping (AI: 401/429/502/503), BusinessError wrappers. | `backend/src/errors/AppError.ts` |
| Firestore transaction read-after-write | **409** | `INFRA_TRANSACTION_CONFLICT`. The only infra error that the handler treats as 409 because the client can safely retry. | inline in `errorHandler.ts` |
| `Error` (plain) | **500** | Anything else. `INFRA_999 / severity: critical`. This is the "we crashed" signal. | global catch-all in `errorHandler.ts` |

The full mapping lives in `backend/src/errors/errorHandler.ts` (one function, ~200 lines, exhaustively commented in place).

## 2. The guard attribution (Law 5)

Every guard rejection carries a `guard: 'sales' | 'purchases' | 'accounting' | 'inventory' | 'system'` so the client can always see *which* guard refused and *why*. The handler emits this alongside the structured `code` and `message` so the envelope is uniform across modules.

| Module | Guard | Error class |
|---|---|---|
| Sales (quotes, orders, invoices, returns, delivery notes, settlement) | `'sales'` | `SalesRuleError extends PostingError` |
| Purchases (PO, GRN, PI, PR, settlement) | `'purchases'` | `PurchaseRuleError extends PostingError` |
| Accounting (vouchers, posting, period lock) | `'accounting'` | `VoucherRuleError extends PostingError`, `PeriodLockedError extends PostingError` |
| Inventory / system | `'inventory'` / `'system'` | reserved for inventory rule errors and system fallbacks |

The three `*RuleError` classes share the same shape — extending `PostingError` and stamping the guard. They are the only way to refuse a request with a domain code; `throw new Error('…')` is reserved for genuine bugs and infra failures.

## 3. The codes

`backend/src/errors/ErrorCodes.ts` is the **only** place codes are declared. Adding a new business-rule rejection means adding a code there and referencing it from the throw site — do not hardcode strings.

```
SALES_001  SALES_TRANSITION_BLOCKED            (existing)
SALES_002  SALES_INVALID_STATE                 (Task 246 — wired)
SALES_003  SALES_ALREADY_POSTED                (Task 246 — wired)

PURCH_001  PURCHASES_TRANSITION_BLOCKED        (existing)

VOUCH_001..011 (existing, including VOUCH_INVALID_STATUS = VOUCH_004 — reused by Task 246)
```

> The over-payment / settlement-rule sales rejections already use `SalesRuleError` (with the free-string codes `OVERPAYMENT_NOT_ALLOWED` / `SETTLEMENT_RULE_VIOLATION`) from Task 242 — they were already 4xx and were not touched by Task 246. The purchases mirror (`PurchaseRuleError`) exists as the designated purchases guard class but its throw sites are **not yet converted** (logged follow-up).

## 4. Worked example — the full envelope

```ts
// In the use case:
throw new SalesRuleError(
  ErrorCode.SALES_INVALID_STATE,
  `Cannot post a sales invoice in status ${si.status}; it must be DRAFT.`,
  { fieldHints: ['status'], context: { status: si.status } }
);
```

The client receives:

```json
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "SALES_002",
    "message": "Cannot post a sales invoice in status CANCELLED; it must be DRAFT.",
    "category": "CONFLICT",
    "severity": "error",
    "guard": "sales",
    "details": {
      "violations": [
        { "code": "SALES_002", "message": "Cannot post a sales invoice in status CANCELLED; it must be DRAFT.", "fieldHints": ["status"] }
      ]
    },
    "fieldHints": ["status"],
    "timestamp": "2026-06-19T22:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The frontend `errorHandler.ts` already unwraps this envelope and pushes the `message` to the toast (see [frontend error handling](../../frontend/src/lib/errorHandler.ts)). A clearer `code` + `message` means a clearer toast — no more "Request failed with status code 500" walls of text.

## 5. The rule (one paragraph)

**When refusing a request, throw a `*RuleError extends PostingError` (or one of the existing specialized subclasses). Do not throw `new Error(...)` for lifecycle, state, settlement, or any other business-rule guard. The `errorHandler` will surface a 4xx with the right `code` and `guard`.**

There is **no** silent-200 carve-out. An already-completed operation (e.g. re-posting a `POSTED` invoice) is rejected with a clean **400** (`SALES_ALREADY_POSTED`) and creates no duplicate — a double action is *visibly* refused rather than silently swallowed. (This was a deliberate choice over the `SubmitVoucherUseCase` APPROVED-returns-voucher precedent; for posting, an explicit refusal is safer.)

## 6. Verifying the contract

Two jest suites own this contract (run via `npm --prefix backend test`):

- `backend/src/tests/application/sales/SalesRuleErrorMapping.test.ts` — pre-existing: proves sales rejections render as 400 with the right `code` + `guard: 'sales'`.
- `backend/src/tests/application/sales/ErrorTaxonomyBusinessRuleMapping.test.ts` — Task 246: re-post of an already-POSTED SI → 400 `SALES_ALREADY_POSTED` (no duplicate voucher); posting a non-DRAFT SI → 400 `SALES_INVALID_STATE`; re-submitting a PENDING voucher → 400 `VOUCH_INVALID_STATUS`; `VoucherEntity.submit` on an APPROVED voucher → 400 `VOUCH_INVALID_STATUS`. 4 tests, all green.

The full sales + accounting + domain-accounting groups (61 suites / 505 tests) pass with these changes.

## 7. What changed in Task 246

The 3 genuine leak sites (the over-payment guard was already 4xx from Task 242):

1. `SalesInvoiceUseCases.ts` `PostSalesInvoiceUseCase.execute` — not-found → `SalesRuleError(SALES_INVALID_STATE)`; already-`POSTED` → `SalesRuleError(SALES_ALREADY_POSTED)` (no duplicate voucher); other non-`DRAFT` → `SalesRuleError(SALES_INVALID_STATE)`. All 400.
2. `SubmitVoucherUseCase.ts` — non-DRAFT/REJECTED submit → `VoucherRuleError(VOUCH_INVALID_STATUS)`. 400.
3. `VoucherEntity.ts` `submit()` — same guard / code. 400.

**Not done (logged follow-up):** the purchases mirror. `PurchaseRuleError` exists as the designated purchases guard class, but `PurchaseInvoiceUseCases` / `PurchaseOrderUseCases` / `PurchaseReturnUseCases` / purchases `PaymentSyncUseCases` throw sites were **not** converted — there is no QA-confirmed 500 leak there today. The `VoucherEntity` lifecycle methods beyond `submit` were also left as-is. **Genuine infrastructure errors are unchanged — still 500 / `INFRA_999` / `critical`.**

## 8. Frontend impact

The frontend `errorHandler.ts` / `errorInterceptor.ts` already unwraps the structured envelope. The fix is transparent to the UI: a user clicking **Post** on a `CANCELLED` sales invoice now sees a localized toast reading "Sales invoice cannot be posted from status CANCELLED…" instead of "Request failed with status code 500". No frontend code change is required.

## 9. Frontend fallback for genuine 500 errors

Production QA task 278h added a client-side fallback for genuine infrastructure failures that still arrive as `INFRA_999` or generic Axios messages. This does **not** reclassify the backend error and does **not** hide a real server crash. It only makes the user-facing modal name the failed operation and show a safe technical reference.

Relevant files:

- `frontend/src/api/errorInterceptor.ts` enriches structured API errors with `httpStatus`, `apiPath`, and `method`.
- `frontend/src/services/errorHandler.ts` maps known accounting API paths to localized operation names and replaces generic messages such as "An unexpected error occurred" with "`<operation>` failed on the server (HTTP 500)...".
- `frontend/src/components/ErrorModal.tsx` shows a safe technical reference containing method, path, HTTP status, and code.
- `frontend/src/locales/{en,ar,tr}/common.json` owns the user-facing strings.

Rules for future work:

1. Backend business-rule and accounting-control failures must still be fixed at the source with structured 4xx errors and domain codes.
2. The frontend fallback is only for true infrastructure failures or unknown crashes.
3. Do not expose stack traces, secrets, request bodies, tenant ids, or raw server internals in the modal.
4. When adding a high-value page that can fail with a generic 500, add its API path to `getOperationLabel()` so support can identify the broken operation from a screenshot.
