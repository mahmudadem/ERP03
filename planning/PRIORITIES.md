# ERP03 — Agent Priorities

> **All agents read this file at session start.**
> It is the single source of truth for what to work on next.
> After completing any item, update this file and append to `planning/JOURNAL.md`.

## 🔴 Current Priority (work this first)

**Commit Field Library C1/C2 checkpoint** (~10 min)
- C1 and C2 are implemented and validated locally.
- Commit only the scoped Field Library files; do not sweep unrelated work.

---

## 🟡 Up Next (in order)

1. **Task 135 — Field Library drift warnings** (~2-4 hours): add `fieldVersionsSeen` and company-form drift notices.
2. **Phase F — RFQ** (~2-3 hours): Request for Quotation — procure-to-pay workflow parity.
3. **Phase G — Purchases-specific** (three-way match + vendor master, ~3–4 days)

---

## 🚫 Do NOT work on (deferred / blocked)

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Full free-canvas invoice designer | Deferred — controlled template model in use |
| Email delivery execution | Follow-up channel, deferred post-D.8 |
| `record_change_logs` Firestore index | Ready, awaiting production deploy |

---

## 🔒 Task Lock (prevent collisions between agents)

If you are starting work on a priority item, record it here so other agents don't duplicate:

| Agent | Task | Started | Status |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| Codex | Phase F - PI Attachments | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Done |
| Codex | Phase F - Vendor Groups | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Done |
| Antigravity | Phase F - Purchase Price Lists | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Done |
| Codex | Task 135 - Field Library Phase C1 | 2026-05-30 | ✅ Done |
| Codex | Task 135 - Field Library Phase C2 | 2026-05-30 | ✅ Done |

**How to use:**
1. Before starting, add a row with your agent name, task, and today's date
2. When done, mark Status = ✅ Done and move the item to `planning/done/`
3. Update `planning/ACTIVE.md` and append to `planning/JOURNAL.md`

## 📋 Carry-forward Rabbit Holes

These are known issues that don't block current work. Do not fix unless specifically tasked:

- Commission accrual auto-wired (B.0) — not yet auto-invoked in SO/SI
- Credit-hold enforcement live (B.2) — not on direct SIs
- `record_change_logs` composite index in `firestore.indexes.json` — needs production deploy
- D.2 period-lock override UI missing on SO detail page (History button present, no posting)
- AI-assistant: 3 test failures in `SendChatMessageUseCase` + 1 in `AiModelCertificationUseCase`
