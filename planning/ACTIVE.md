# 🎯 Current Focus

**Task:** Phase F — Purchases parity. Purchase Price Lists now built and ready for QA (2026-05-28).
**Status:** In progress on `codex/phase-f-vendor-groups`. Remaining parity gaps: RFQ.
**Latest completion reports:** [127-tailwind-play-theme-and-styling.md](./done/127-tailwind-play-theme-and-styling.md), [128-coa-template-defaults-and-comprehensive-coa.md](./done/128-coa-template-defaults-and-comprehensive-coa.md), [129-phase-f-pi-attachments.md](./done/129-phase-f-pi-attachments.md), [130-phase-f-vendor-groups.md](./done/130-phase-f-vendor-groups.md), [131-purchase-price-lists.md](./done/131-purchase-price-lists.md).

## 👉 Next agent — start here

Piece A and Piece B are complete:

1. Customer/vendor per-party AR/AP account generation is implemented.
2. Backfill is available for existing parties.
3. Customer Statement now uses `GetAccountStatementUseCase` through `Party.defaultARAccountId`.
4. Statement rows are decorated from voucher metadata for source-document and accounting-voucher drill-down.
5. Open Sales Orders can be included as non-balance commitments.

Vendor Statement parity is now also complete:

1. Vendor Statement uses `GetAccountStatementUseCase` through `Party.defaultAPAccountId`.
2. Missing AP account returns `VENDOR_AP_ACCOUNT_MISSING`.
3. AP balances display as positive amount owed while preserving ledger debit/credit sides.
4. Rows are decorated from voucher metadata for Purchases source-document and accounting-voucher drill-down.
5. Open Purchase Orders can be included as non-balance commitments.

Phase F progress:
1. Ledger-backed AR Aging — migrated from Sales-only _buildRawEvents to Accounting ledger with unallocated diff display.
2. AP Aging report — new, mirrors AR Aging for vendors via defaultAPAccountId.
3. Purchases Analytics — purchases-by-vendor + purchases-by-item reports, frontend page with mode toggle.
4. Purchase Audit Log — reused RecordAuditController, wired to /tenant/purchase/audit-log.
5. Dead code cleanup — removed old GetCustomerStatementUseCase and its tests.
6. PI Attachments — tenant-scoped vendor bill/supporting evidence attachments on Purchase Invoices (report 129).
7. Vendor Groups — optional supplier segmentation master data with vendor Party assignment (report 130).
8. Purchase Price Lists — optional currency-specific supplier pricing agreements (report 131).

Remaining parity gaps (prioritized):
- RFQ (Request for Quotation) — bigger feature, 2-3 hours

## Earlier focus (archived for context)

**Task:** Sales completion roadmap — **Phases A ✅ B ✅ C ✅ D (all) ✅ E ✅**
**Status:** running phases autonomously (manual QA gates deferred per user instruction)
**Branch:** `feat/phase-a-sales-master-data`
**Plan:** [planning/tasks/sales-and-purchases-completion-roadmap.md](./tasks/sales-and-purchases-completion-roadmap.md)
**Done reports:** [108 — Phase A](./done/108-phase-a-master-data-pricing.md), [109 — Phase B](./done/109-phase-b-sales-operational.md), [110 — Phase C](./done/110-phase-c-sales-finance-reporting.md), [111 — Phase D.2+D.3](./done/111-phase-d-period-lock-audit-log.md), [112 — Phase D.4](./done/112-phase-d4-recurring-invoices.md), [113 — Phase D hardening audit](./done/113-phase-d-audit-hardening.md), [114 — Phase D.5 sales-return enhancements](./done/114-phase-d5-sales-return-enhancements.md), [115 — Phase D.7 invoice templates](./done/115-phase-d7-invoice-templates.md), [116 — Phase D.8 WhatsApp outbound messaging](./done/116-phase-d8-whatsapp-outbound-messaging.md), [117 — D.8 multi-tenant sender-accounts hardening](./done/117-d8-multitenant-messaging-hardening.md), [118 — D.8 Telegram outbound execution](./done/118-d8-telegram-outbound-execution.md), [119 — Phase D.6 invoice attachments](./done/119-phase-d6-invoice-attachments.md), [120 — Phase E sales cleanup](./done/120-phase-e-sales-cleanup.md)

## Where we are

Phases A, B, C are built, type-clean, and unit-tested. Phase D control stack is now complete: D.2 Period Lock, D.3 per-record audit log, D.4 recurring invoices, D.5 sales-return enhancements, D.6 invoice attachments, D.7 controlled invoice templates, and D.8 outbound messaging.

Latest hardening (report 117) corrected D.8 architecture to true multi-tenant behavior:
- per-company sender accounts in `Sales Settings -> Communications`
- encrypted per-account credentials
- multiple sender accounts per company with default/active routing
- invoice send modal supports sender selection per message

Phase D is now functionally closed. Email delivery execution remains a follow-up channel under the tenant-scoped provider/account abstraction.

Commits on `feat/phase-a-sales-master-data`:
- `5949f314` — Phase A (master data & pricing)
- `4e9ce801` — Phase B.0–B.3 checkpoint
- `b9718462` — Phase B.4–B.6
- _(pending)_ — Phase C
- _(pending)_ — Phase C/D commits not yet finalized in this branch snapshot

## Carried-forward follow-ups

- Promotion evaluator built + tested but not auto-invoked in SO/SI creation.
- Credit check enforced at SO confirm only — not on direct SIs.
- Backorder / partial-fulfillment frontend UX deferred.
- Quote numbering uses a `Q-<timestamp>` fallback (no sequence in SalesSettings).
- Commission accrual auto-wired (B.0); credit-hold enforcement live (B.2).
- AI-assistant test failures currently present in full suite: 3 in `SendChatMessageUseCase` (credits/runtime-mode path) + 1 in `AiModelCertificationUseCase` (global recommended query expectation). Unrelated to Sales D8 but now tracked for stabilization.
- D.2 period-lock override UI wired on SI/DN/SR detail pages; SO detail page has History button but no posting (SO confirm already has credit-override flow).
- **D.3 follow-up — SO confirm/cancel/close and SI payment record/status are NOT audited** (only Create/Update/Post/Override are). Add in Phase E if needed.
- **🔥 Scheduled Tasks Engine (HIGH PRIORITY, blocks recurring features across modules)** — D.4 ships templates + a manual "Generate Due" button but NO scheduler. Same gap will hit HR payroll, Accounting recurring vouchers, Purchase recurring POs, system cleanup, etc. Build a single shared engine that every module registers against, not per-feature crons. Spec: [planning/tasks/scheduled-tasks-engine.md](./tasks/scheduled-tasks-engine.md). User-facing notice added to Recurring Invoices page in the meantime.
- **D.2 follow-up — Period-lock override governance (Phase E):**
  - Role-gate the **Override Period Lock** button so only authorized roles (e.g. Controller / CFO / Accounting Manager) see it. Hide for staff/operators.
  - Add a clear option in **Accounting → Settings → Fiscal** under Period Locking:
    - Toggle: **Allow soft-lock overrides** (default ON). When OFF, the override path is fully disabled and the soft lock behaves like a hard lock for all users.
    - Multi-select: **Roles permitted to override** (default: Controller, CFO).
  - Backend must enforce both — UI gating is not enough; the override endpoint must re-check role + the allow-override toggle and reject otherwise (clear error, audit-logged attempt).
- `record_change_logs` Firestore composite index added to `firestore.indexes.json` — must be deployed before production use.
- ✅ **COA template defaults fixed (2026-05-28):**
  - Generic catch-all defaults added across templates for perpetual-mode readiness:
    - AP (`20100 Accounts Payable - General`)
    - Revenue (`400 Sales Revenue` in Standard + aligned revenue defaults in industry templates)
    - COGS (`50100 Cost of Goods Sold - General` where applicable)
    - GRNI (`209` in Standard/industry templates; `203` GRNI in Simplified)
  - Comprehensive template upgraded from placeholder to full enterprise chart.
  - Related commits: `30055d9f`, `4385873d`.
  - Follow-up: add wizard-side validation/auto-create warning when required perpetual defaults do not resolve.
- `PeriodLockService` is now wired into `buildAccountingPostingService()` — enforcement is live for all Sales posting paths.
- D.7 full free-canvas/sketch-board invoice designer is deferred; current model is controlled template selection via Forms Designer templates.

6. **⚠ Sales QA cycle** — Phase C run 2026-05-27, conditionally passing; see [121 — Phase C QA Results](./done/121-phase-c-qa-results.md). 11 findings; 1 report-code bug (credit notes missing from Customer Statement/Ledger), the rest upstream data/COA issues.
7. **Phase F** — Purchases parity — 4-5 days
8. **Phase G** — Purchases-specific (three-way match + vendor master) — 3-4 days
9. **Phase H** — Final hardening — 1 week

## Next action

Next step is to manually QA **Vendor Groups**, then continue **Phase F Purchases parity** with **Purchase Price Lists**, then RFQ.
